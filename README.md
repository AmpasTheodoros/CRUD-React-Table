# CRUD React Table

This repository contains a CRUD (create, read, update, delete) table built using React and Redux. The table allows users to add, view, edit, and delete rows of data, as well as filter and sort the data.

## Getting Started

To use the table, clone or download the repository and run `npm install` and `npm start` to start the development server. The table can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Features

- The table displays a list of rows, each with columns for different data fields such as name, email, and status.
- The table allows users to add new rows by entering data in the provided fields and clicking the "Add" button.
- The table allows users to edit existing rows by clicking on the row and updating the data in the fields.
- The table allows users to delete rows by clicking on the row and clicking the "Delete" button.
- The table allows users to filter the rows by a search term and sort the rows by different data fields.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to add additional features to the table such as:

- The ability for users to save and load their data and settings.
- The ability to customize the appearance of the table, including the color and font.
- The ability to add additional data fields and column types, such as dates and numbers.

## Credits

This project was created by [AmpasTheodoros](https://github.com/AmpasTheodoros) as a way to learn and practice React and Redux. The data used in the table was generated using [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/).
